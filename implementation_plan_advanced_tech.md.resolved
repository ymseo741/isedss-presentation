# Implementation Plan: Advanced Technical Maturity Enhancements

This plan details the addition of three advanced technical slides to solidify the I-SEDSS presentation's competitive edge in AI training, global operations, and maritime security.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. New Slide: [AI Training & Synthetic Data Pipeline]
- **Goal**: Explain how the AI achieves high accuracy without abundant real-world maritime fire data.
- **Position**: Follows Slide 01-4 (Decision Intelligence Framework).
- **Content**:
  - **FDS-to-AI Pipeline**: Exporting Fire Dynamics Simulator data into AI training sets.
  - **Scenario Generation**: Automated generation of 10,000+ edge-case scenarios (smoke densities, ship models, human traffic).
  - **Digital Twin Loop**: "Simulation -> Learning -> Deployment -> Feedback" cycle.
- **Visual**: A "Synthetic Data Factory" diagram.

### 2. New Slide: [Maritime Cyber-Physical Security]
- **Goal**: Demonstrate how the system protects critical safety data from cyber threats.
- **Position**: Follows Slide 13 (Risk Mitigation).
- **Content**:
  - **Bus Protection**: Securing NMEA 2000 from falsified PGN messages.
  - **Hardware Root of Trust (RoT)**: TPM-based secure boot for Edge Nodes.
  - **Zero-Trust Network**: Mutual TLS (mTLS) for all internal communication between sensors and dashboard.
- **Visual**: A "Shielded Data Bus" infographic.

### 3. New Slide: [Global OTA & Remote Operations]
- **Goal**: Show global scalability through Starlink-enabled remote management.
- **Position**: Follows Slide 15 (Global Vision).
- **Content**:
  - **OTA Delta Updates**: Minimal bandwidth usage via incremental binary patches.
  - **Remote Health Monitoring**: 24/7 telemetry for sensor health and AI inference drift.
  - **Multi-region Support**: Seamless operation regardless of maritime zone via Starlink.
- **Visual**: A "Global Dashboard to Ship" update flow.

## Task Details
- **Sync task.md**: Add Phase 4 items.
- **Update presentation.html**: 
  - Insert the 3 new slides.
  - **Re-number ALL subsequent page footers accurately**.
  - Adjust CSS gaps to ensure high density without clipping.

## Verification Plan
1. **Browser Audit**: Check all page numbers (now reaching ~37 slides).
2. **Technical Review**: Ensure algorithms/specs (PGNs, AEA, FDS) are correctly cited.
3. **Mermaid Check**: Verify that new diagrams render without syntax errors.
