# Implementation Plan: Technical Depth & Competitive Differentiation Enhancement

This plan focuses on elevating the technical credibility and market positioning of the I-SEDSS presentation by adding specialized technical slides and refining existing specifications.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. New Slide: [Decision Intelligence Framework]
- **Goal**: Explain the "Brain" behind the system to demonstrate technical superiority.
- **Content**: 
  - Visual diagram of the data flow from Multi-modal sensors.
  - Explanation of the AI algorithms:
    - **TOPSIS**: Multi-criteria decision-making for optimal path selection.
    - **GNN/DPOP**: Multi-agent coordination for bottleneck prediction.
    - **Petri Net**: Scenario modeling for life-cycle management.
- **Visuals**: A structured "AI Pipeline" flowchart.

### 2. New Slide: [Global Standard & Regulation Compliance]
- **Goal**: Highlight competitive differentiation by showing international readiness.
- **Content**:
  - **IMO MSC.1/Circ.1238**: Detailed mapping of how our system exceeds standard evacuation analysis requirements.
  - **ISO 23611**: Compliance with maritime environmental monitoring standards.
  - **NMEA 2000 / IEC 61162**: Ship-wide data bus integration and certification plan.
- **Visuals**: Compliance badges or a "Standard-to-Feature" mapping table.

### 3. [MODIFY] [presentation.html](file:///Users/seo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5fa3caba-c837-49e5-8344-a4fa3ac58405/presentation.html)
- **Slide 22 (Hardware Specs)**: 
  - Replace generic descriptions with specific technical parameters.
  - Example: LiDAR (32-ch, 200m range), Thermal (Resolution 640x480, <50mK), Edge Node (Jetson Orin based, 275 TOPS).
- **Slide 29 (Emergency Scenario)**:
  - Add a dedicated "Logical Flow" for **Reverse Direction Dynamic Guidance** (when a primary path is blocked by fire/smoke).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- No automated tests required as this is an HTML presentation.

### Manual Verification
1. **Browser Review**: 
   - Open [presentation.html](file:///Users/seo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5fa3caba-c837-49e5-8344-a4fa3ac58405/presentation.html) in Chrome/Safari.
   - Verify that new slides (AI Framework, Compliance) are properly numbered and fit the 16:9 layout.
   - Check if Slide 22 specs are updated correctly.
2. **Visual Audit**:
   - Ensure Mermaid diagrams in new slides render without syntax errors.
   - Verify that font sizes remain consistent with existing "Ultra-Dense" styling.
