# I-SEDSS Presentation Finalization Walkthrough

This document details the complete enhancement, restructuring, and visual upgrade of the I-SEDSS business proposal presentation.

## 🚀 Key Achievements

### 1. Structural Overhaul (9 Sections)
The presentation was reorganized from a linear deck into a persuasive business flow:
*   **I-III**: Strategy, Architecture, Core Tech (AI/XAI)
*   **IV-V**: Infrastructure, Mobile Service & SOP
*   **VI-IX**: Competitive Edge, Global Roadmap, KPI

### 2. "Team & Capability" Strengthened
We added a dedicated "Organization" chapter (Slides 07, 07-A, 07-B, 07-C) to highlight the consortium's expertise:
*   **Lead Organization (ODN)**: Highlighted as the Control Tower & Platform Leader.
*   **Joint Research Orgs**: Detailed Tech (Hanbit, Research Assoc) and Domain (CNU, KCL) partners.
*   **Ecosystem Map**: A Hub-and-Spoke visual connecting all 5 partners.

### 3. High-Impact Visuals Added
We replaced generic text/diagrams with "Tangible" visual evidence:
*   **Visual SOP (Flowchart)**: A horizontal process flow replacing text lists.
*   **Integrated Control Dashboard**: A realistic dark-mode "Command Center" UI.
*   **Golden Time Timeline**: A comparative bar chart showing 99% faster response.
*   **Glass-Box XAI**: A CSS visualization showing AI decision logic.

### 4. Final Polish
*   **Full Name Standardization**: "해양수산과학기술연구조합" used consistently across all tables and diagrams.
*   **Closing Slide**: A professional "Thank You / Q&A" slide added to conclude the presentation.

## 📄 Final Artifacts
*   **Presentation File**: [presentation.html](file:///Users/seo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5fa3caba-c837-49e5-8344-a4fa3ac58405/presentation.html)
*   **Restructuring Script**: [restructure.py](file:///Users/seo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5fa3caba-c837-49e5-8344-a4fa3ac58405/restructure.py)

The presentation is now a comprehensive, visually compelling digital proposal ready for stakeholder review.
