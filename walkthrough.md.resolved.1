# I-SEDSS Presentation Development Walkthrough

This document summarizes the comprehensive enhancements and technical refinements made to the I-SEDSS Business Proposal presentation.

## 🚀 Phase 4: Advanced Technical Maturity & Operations

In the final phase, we focused on adding critical technical depth and refining the visual presentation for maximum professional impact.

### 1. Advanced Technical Slides Integrated
Three new slides were added to showcase high-level system maturity and scalability:
- **Slide 01-5: Synthetic Data & AI Training Pipeline**: Explains how digital twins and FDS simulations are used to generate robust training data.
- **Slide 13-1: Maritime Cyber-Physical Security**: Details the hardware-level security (TPM 2.0, Secure Boot) and network IDS for NMEA-2000.
- **Slide 15-1: Global OTA & Remote Operations**: Showcases global fleet management and Delta Binary OTA updates via Starlink.

### 2. Layout & Visibility Improvements
- **Slide 01-4 (Decision Intelligence Framework)**: Resolved Mermaid diagram overflow by optimizing container spacing and scaling.
- **Slide 11-1 (Global Standards)**: Increased font sizes and enhanced technical detail for better readability.
- **Slide 13-1 & 15-1 Style Fixes**: Updated previous dark/low-contrast boxes to a clean, professional light-mode style with high contrast, as requested by the user.

### 3. Logic & Content Refinement
- **Slide 16 (Emergency SOP)**: Updated Scenario D to "Reverse Direction Dynamic Guidance" and synchronized the Mermaid diagram logic to include reverse retreat paths.
- **Hardware Metrics**: Slide 18-1 and Slide 16 were updated with rigorous technical specifications (TOPS, CUDA cores, IP ratings, etc.).

## 📊 Final Status: Complete
- **Total Slides**: 37
- **Page Numbering**: A comprehensive audit was performed. All 37 footers are perfectly sequential.
- **Visual Verification**: All slides were verified in the browser for correct scaling and readability.
